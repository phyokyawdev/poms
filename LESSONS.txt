DATA TYPES AT DIFFERENT LAYERS
- debuggin at route and service layer need human readable format
- external lib use buffer format
- network request need extra parsing
- BigInt was handled differently via wallet and node
soln by 
- buffer at db layer and hex at other layers
- adapter pattern with hex for external libs

JAVASCRIPT PROXIES
- using apply trap for target functions causing problems with 
  methods that use internal context of target
- using both get and apply trap is causing problems
soln by
- apply trap is binded with this of proxy object itself
- use get and rebind this to target object for functions,
  so, methods that use internal context would functions correctly

toJSON/toString METHOD 
- should utilize toJSON() method to add hex prefix inside req and res
- should utilize toString() method to add hex prefix inside console

ABSTRACTION
- modify toString() or toJSON() to parse with hex prefix
- need more work on data type representation in different level
- transaction (public, need hex prefix)
- merkle roots (private to nodes, no need hex prefix)
- blockchain (private to nodes, so no need of hex prefix)
  - block (private, no need hex prefix)

LEVEL DB 
- not support structured values, or partially updating a value

NETWORK NODE STORE 
- should store list of nodes with flat file or json?
